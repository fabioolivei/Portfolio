- **Situation:** In a health clinic, we attend to about 10,000 patients a month, of which 1,000 have diabetes. Before our project, only 150 of those cases were diagnosed in time for effective treatment.

- **Task:** Our mission was to develop a Machine Learning model capable of predicting diabetes cases with high precision and recall, aiming for early intervention and improved patient health management.

- **Action:** We decided to use an optimized XGBoost model for the task, due to its superior performance in classification tasks. After development, the model was implemented through a Gradio application, hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, making it accessible and easy to use by clinic staff.

- **Result:** With the deployment of our optimized model, we were able to identify 900 patients as potential diabetes cases, of which 750 actually had the disease and were diagnosed. This represented a significant increase in the detection of diabetes cases, jumping from only 150 diagnoses to 750, thanks to our diabetes prediction model.

**Situation:** A company processes R$ 500 billion in transactions, within which R$ 7.5 billion are fraudulent. Without an effective detection model, the company was only able to detect and prevent 15% of these frauds, equating to R$ 1.125 billion, leaving R$ 6.375 billion in frauds undetected.

**Task:** The critical task was to enhance fraud detection capabilities to mitigate the substantial financial losses incurred due to undetected frauds. The goal was to leverage Machine Learning to significantly improve the detection and prevention of fraudulent transactions.

**Action:** In this project, we embarked on developing and fine-tuning a Machine Learning model to accurately identify fraudulent transactions. Through rigorous experimentation and optimization, the best performing model identified was an advanced Machine Learning model, specifically designed to pinpoint fraudulent activities with high precision.

**Result:** With the implementation of the optimal Machine Learning model, we managed to identify R$ 7.05 billion as potential frauds. Remarkably, R$ 6.2 billion of this amount were confirmed frauds, which the model successfully helped to avoid. Consequently, the company managed to significantly reduce its losses by preventing an additional R$ 6.2 billion in fraudulent transactions. This outcome underscores the pivotal role of Machine Learning in enhancing operational efficiency and safeguarding financial assets.

**Situation:** The landscape of YouTube has become increasingly diverse, with channels from around the world contributing to a rich tapestry of content. Recognizing the importance of understanding this ecosystem, our analysis aimed to explore the most popular YouTube channels, their categories, and the influence of different countries on the platform. Key success metrics such as the number of subscribers and video views were central to our examination, as these factors are crucial in understanding the revenue potential for creators.

**Task:** Our primary task was to conduct a thorough analysis to identify trends, patterns, and correlations within the YouTube platform. This included categorizing channels by country and genre, analyzing subscriber and view counts, and assessing the impact of these metrics on creators' earnings. The ultimate goal was to provide insights that could aid in optimizing content and marketing strategies for better engagement and profitability.

**Action:** We initiated our analysis by performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain a fundamental understanding of the dataset. This involved:
- Conducting a detailed statistical description of the dataset to identify basic trends and patterns.
- Performing a temporal analysis to see how certain variables changed over time and their impact on the platform.
- Analyzing the count of channels from different countries and categorizing them to simplify comparisons and understand thematic distributions.
- Investigating trends and correlations, particularly focusing on how engagement metrics like subscriber counts and video views relate to profitability.

**Result:** Through our comprehensive analysis, we were able to uncover valuable insights into the YouTube ecosystem. We identified key trends that highlight the relationship between engagement and profitability, revealing that certain categories and countries dominate in terms of subscriber counts and views. Our findings underscore the critical role of data analysis and analytics in content and marketing strategy optimization. By understanding these dynamics, content creators and marketers can make informed decisions to enhance their content's appeal and reach, ultimately increasing engagement and revenue. This analysis not only provided a snapshot of the current YouTube landscape but also offered strategic insights for optimizing future content creation and distribution.

- **Business Understanding:**
The dataset focuses on predicting health insurance costs based on factors such as age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), number of children, smoking status, and region. Understanding these relationships is crucial for insurers to price policies accurately.

**Situation:** Without an effective risk prediction model for health insurance, an insurer serving 50,000 clients faces a yearly challenge: 5,000 of these clients incur high and unexpected medical expenses. This lack of foresight prevents the insurer from adjusting its policies and pricing accurately, resulting in significant financial losses.

**Task:** To mitigate these losses and improve accuracy in insurance policy pricing, the insurer needs to develop a Machine Learning model capable of identifying clients at high risk of incurring elevated medical expenses in advance, taking into account variables such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region.

**Action:** The insurer opted to implement an optimized Gradient Boosting Regressor model, recognized for its superior performance in regression tasks. This model was trained to analyze clients' historical data and risk factors, identifying those most likely to generate high costs. The analysis and modeling considered factors such as the number of children, smoking habits, and BMI, as well as evaluated regional differences to adapt pricing and coverage strategies more effectively.

**Result:** With the implementation of the Gradient Boosting Regressor model, the insurer was able to accurately identify 4,000 clients with the potential for high medical expenses, of which 3,500 actually incurred elevated costs. This advancement allowed the insurer to better adjust its policies and pricing strategies for these clients, avoiding surprises and financial losses. Adopting this model not only increased operational efficiency and financial sustainability for the insurer but also enabled the offering of more personalized and fair health plans, significantly improving customer satisfaction and service. This data-driven approach reinforces the power of risk analysis and predictive modeling in optimizing health insurance management.

- **Objective:** The aim is to analyze a Fast Food Marketing Campaign dataset to understand the impact of different promotions on sales and identify the most effective strategies.

- **Key Question:** Which marketing promotions are most effective in driving sales?

**Statistical Significance (p-values)**:
- Promotion 1 vs Promotion 2: p-value â‰ˆ 4.29e-10
- Promotion 1 vs Promotion 3: p-value â‰ˆ 0.121
- Promotion 2 vs Promotion 3: p-value â‰ˆ 1.57e-06

Evaluation
- A/B Testing Results: Identified that Promotion 1 and Promotion 3 are statistically more effective than Promotion 2.
- Cross-Validation: Lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE): The lowest value, 0.085, suggests a relatively good performance of the model in that specific fold, indicating that the model had an average squared error of approximately 85 sales (when we multiply by 1000 to convert back to the original scale of 'SalesInThousands').

- ### Data Acquisition:
All data used here were obtained from the Inside Airbnb website.

- ### Why Travel to Lisbon?
Imagine embarking on a journey that takes you to a place where the roots of Brazil's history are deeply intertwined, be it through its architecture, cuisine, and hospitality. The city boasts renowned museums such as the National Tile Museum and the National Museum of Ancient Art, and a traditional cuisine with dishes like codfish and pastÃ©is de nata.

- ### Conclusion:
Based on the data and analyses conducted, we observe that the majority of properties in Lisbon listed on Airbnb are full houses or apartments available for rent. Moreover, there is also a significant number of private rooms available. We can also define the average of the highest and lowest values for the 10 neighborhoods.
